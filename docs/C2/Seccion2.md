# Define your site's address

By default, your username and the repository name will be shown on your website URL address once it's published. It should be: **your_username.github.io/TowerBuilder**.

1. If you wish to change _your_username_, you can [change your username](https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-your-github-username) or [create an organization account in Github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) and choose the organization when you fork the repository. If you've already created the repository, you can [move it to the organization account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/transferring-a-repository).

2. If you wish to change the TowerBuilder part, you can [rename the repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/renaming-a-repository).

3. GitHub.com allows the use of custom domains, you can check the documentation [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages).

## Using a custom subdomain

To use a custom subdomain, you need to modify its DNS. You can do it on the website where the domain has been registered.

You need to add a CNAME that takes you to username.github.io. For more details, check [GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-a-custom-subdomain).

**Important:** Don't use the same URL as in the original repository because you won't be able to see the site.
