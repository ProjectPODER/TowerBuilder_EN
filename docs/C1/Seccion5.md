# Publish the website

Once you've configured your website, imported data and edited texts, you can publish the website to verify that everything works as it should.

At first, your username and the repository name will be reflected on your website URL address once it's published. It should be **your_username.github.io/your_repository**.

1. Below your repository name there are several tabs. Click on the last one: “_Settings_”.
2. Scroll down to _GitHub Pages_ section, and click on _Source_ the _master branch_ option.
3. The page will refresh, scroll down again to _Github Pages_ and you should see **Your site is ready to be published at _your_url_** on top of the section.

   **Note:** After publishing your site for the first time, you can customize the URL. For more information about setting your website address, click [here](https://towerbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/C2/Seccion3.html).

4. Click on the URL to see your published site.

For more information, you can check [GitHub's official documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages).

**Important:** Don't use the same URL as in the original repository because you won't be able to see the site.

## Iframe versions

Tower Builder has versions that can be inserted as an iframe in other websites, after publishing your site you can access this version by adding the parameter **_?iframe_** to your url. For example, to see the iframe version of our demo, you can visit this link: 

<https://towerbuilder.projectpoder.org/?iframe>.

To insert the visualization or slider iframe, add to your url **_/iframe-visualization_** or **_/iframe-slider_**, you can see an example of our demo in the following links:

<https://towerbuilder.projectpoder.org/iframe-visualization/>

<https://towerbuilder.projectpoder.org/iframe-slider/>
