# Fork the repository

In order to start building your website, you need to create your own repository first. A repository is the space where your website’s files are saved. You will be using a _fork_ -that is, a copy- of TowerBuilder’s original repository.

1. You need sign in to GitHub.com. If you don't have an account, you can create one over [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home).

> ***Disclaimer:** GitHub.com is a Microsoft Inc. subsidiary that provides git repositories hosting and web hosting services in a free and simple way. That’s why we chose to use it for posting this project and our organization's code.*

2. GitHub will require an e-mail verification. For more information, you can read the [official documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/verifying-your-email-address).

3. In order to fork the repository, you need to browse to the [repository's home](https://github.com/ProjectPODER/TowerBuilder) and click on "fork", on the upper-right corner of the page. This will create a new page under your user, as in http://github.com/your_username/TowerBuilder. Now, you'll start working there, and you'll be allowed to modify files and publish sites. For further reading, check GitHub article about [how to fork a repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo). You can also read about [forks in general](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-forks).

4. To add outside collaborators, so they can edit data and texts, you must [configure your repository according to the GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).
