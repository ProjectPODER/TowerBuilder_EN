# Building my website with TowerBuilder

TowerBuilder is a website creation tool that doesn't require programming knowledge to create websites featuring contracting data visualization. It's specifically oriented to large public works and it’s inspired by ([TorreDeControl.org](www.torredecontrol.org))  and medical supplies ([VivirConVIH.org](https://livingwithhiv.quienesquien.wiki)).

## What do I need to create my own TowerBuilder website?

- Get an OCDS-format contracting list.
- Create a spreadsheet shared with contracting businesses owners.
- Write and edit text in [MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) format.
- A [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) account.

## What are the advantages of creating websites using TowerBuilder?

- Default design doesn't require any coding or web hosting, everything is done in GitHub.com.
- Visually impressive data visualization and a useful contracting search system.
- If you already have the data, you'll be able to create your website within minutes.
- Highly customizable design.
- You can use open data from your country's government and show how useful the open contracting standard (OCDS) is for journalism.
