## Why is the graphic not showing?

It could be because **contracts.json** is not formatted properly. Please refer to [our documentation](https://towerbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/C1/Seccion3.html#contracting-data) to help you check any errors.

## Why are my articles not showing in the graphic?

Check that each article name is in the right format or correctly linked, as we explain [here](https://towerbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/C1/Seccion4.html#articles).

## Why is my text or article format broken?

Check that the file has an **.md** format.

Check if the file has the right header, as we explain [here](https://towerbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/C1/Seccion4.html#add-an-item-to-menu).

Check you're using items that accept **Markdown** format. You can look through the official documentation over [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
